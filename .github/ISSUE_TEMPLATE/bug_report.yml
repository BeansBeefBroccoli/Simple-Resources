      Before submitting a bug report, please make sure you have read this *entire* form, and that:
      - Your bug is not a vanilla bug/another mod's bug
      - Your issue has not been reported before (make sure to use the [search function](https://github.com/BeansBeefBroccoli/Simple-Resource/issues)!)

      **Do not forget to give your issue a descriptive title.** "there's a bug" isn't useful, and it makes it harder to distinguish issues at a glance.
